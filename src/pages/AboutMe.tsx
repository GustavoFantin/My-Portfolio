              <p>Hi there, I'm Gustavo, a new web developer who has loved technology (and gaming) for as long as I can remember.</p>
              <p>Currently, I'm finishing my web development course at CICCC Vancouver, which has given me a solid foundation in both frontend and backend technologies. Although I'm just starting out, I already consider myself a fullstack developer. Moving forward, I'm excited to improve my knowledge in backend development with Node.js and explore many other programming languages.</p>
              <p>
                I've been having a lot of fun working with tools like React, Node.js, and Next.js to build fast and interactive web apps. TypeScript is my go-to for writing cleaner and safer code.
                On the backend side, I'm comfortable with Express, Socket.io, and databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL â€” which let me create everything from APIs to real-time features.
                For authentication, I use JWT, and when it comes to styling, Tailwind CSS is my favorite way to make things look sharp and responsive
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me shredding on my guitar, at the skatepark, or playing some FPS games. These hobbies keep me relaxed, distracted and happy!
              </p>
